# Windows Setup

Need to have g++ installed, go to this website to setup a g++ compiler [https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/).
When installing, make sure to select the install option for `mingw32-gcc-g++-bin` when installing to include the version of the c++ compiler we need for this project.
Note, you may need to add `C:\MinGW\bin` to your path and restart your terminal.
Then there should be a command for `mingw32-g++.exe` available.

# Compiling the program

Inn order to compile the program, use the following command to setup and create the executable. The executable file will be named `a.out` and be placed in your current working directory.

```bash
mingw32-g++.exe main.cpp
```
